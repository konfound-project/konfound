# konfound

The goal of `konfound` is to carry out sensitivity analysis to help
analysts to *quantify how robust inferences are to potential sources of
bias*. This R package provides tools to carry out sensitivity analysis
as described in Frank, Maroulis, Duong, and Kelcey (2013) based on
Rubin’s (1974) causal model as well as in Frank (2000) based on the
impact threshold for a confounding variable.

# Installation

You can install the CRAN version of konfound with:

``` r
install.packages("konfound")
```

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("konfound-project/konfound")
```

# Use of konfound

## pkonfound() for published studies

`pkonfound()`, for published studies, calculates (1) how much bias there
must be in an estimate to invalidate/sustain an inference, and
interprets in terms of how much data would need to be replaced to
nullify an inference (Robustness of an Inference to Replacement, RIR);
(2) the impact of an omitted variable necessary to invalidate/sustain an
inference for a regression coefficient (Impact Threshold of a
Confounding Variable, ITCV). RIR is reported by default. ITCV can be
generated by specifying `index = "IT"`.

## konfound() for models fit in R

`konfound()` calculates the robustness of inferences for models fit in
R. For example, below are the coefficients for a linear model fit with
`lm()` using the built-in dataset `mtcars`:

``` r
m1 <- lm(mpg ~ wt + disp, data = mtcars)
m1
#> 
#> Call:
#> lm(formula = mpg ~ wt + disp, data = mtcars)
#> 
#> Coefficients:
#> (Intercept)           wt         disp  
#>    34.96055     -3.35083     -0.01772
summary(m1)
#> 
#> Call:
#> lm(formula = mpg ~ wt + disp, data = mtcars)
#> 
#> Residuals:
#>     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
#> -3.4087 -2.3243 -0.7683  1.7721  6.3484 
#> 
#> Coefficients:
#>             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
#> (Intercept) 34.96055    2.16454  16.151 4.91e-16 ***
#> wt          -3.35082    1.16413  -2.878  0.00743 ** 
#> disp        -0.01773    0.00919  -1.929  0.06362 .  
#> ---
#> Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
#> 
#> Residual standard error: 2.917 on 29 degrees of freedom
#> Multiple R-squared:  0.7809, Adjusted R-squared:  0.7658 
#> F-statistic: 51.69 on 2 and 29 DF,  p-value: 2.744e-10
```

Sensitivity analysis for the effect for `wt` on `mpg` can be carried out
as follows, specifying the fitted model object:

``` r
konfound(m1, wt)
#> Robustness of Inference to Replacement (RIR):
#> RIR = 9
#> 
#> To invalidate the inference of an effect using the threshold of -2.381 for
#> statistical significance (with null hypothesis = 0 and alpha = 0.05), 28.946%
#> of the (-3.351) estimate would have to be due to bias. This implies that to
#> invalidate the inference one would expect to have to replace 9 (28.946%)
#> observations with data points for which the effect is 0 (RIR = 9).
#> 
#> See Frank et al. (2013) for a description of the method.
#> 
#> Citation: Frank, K.A., Maroulis, S., Duong, M., and Kelcey, B. (2013).
#> What would it take to change an inference?
#> Using Rubin's causal model to interpret the robustness of causal inferences.
#> Education, Evaluation and Policy Analysis, 35 437-460.
#> 
#> Accuracy of results increases with the number of decimals reported.
#> NULL
```

Similar to `pkonfound`, ITCV can be generated by specifying
`index = "IT"`.

``` r
konfound(m1, wt, index = "IT")
#> Impact Threshold for a Confounding Variable (ITCV):
#> 
#> The minimum (in absolute value) impact of an omitted variable to invalidate
#> an inference for a null hypothesis of an effect of nu (0) is based on
#> a correlation of -0.425 with the outcome and 0.425 with the predictor of
#> interest (conditioning on all observed covariates in the model; signs are
#> interchangeable). This is based on a threshold effect of -0.355 for statistical
#> significance (alpha = 0.05).
#> 
#> Correspondingly the impact of an omitted variable (as defined in Frank 2000) must be
#> -0.425 X 0.425 = -0.18 to invalidate an inference for a null hypothesis of an effect of nu (0).
#> 
#> See Frank (2000) for a description of the method.
#> 
#> Citation:
#> Frank, K. (2000). Impact of a confounding variable on the inference of a
#> regression coefficient. Sociological Methods and Research, 29 (2), 147-194
#> 
#> Accuracy of results increases with the number of decimals reported.
#> 
#> The ITCV analysis was originally derived for OLS standard errors. If the
#> standard errors reported in the table were not based on OLS, some caution
#> should be used to interpret the ITCV.
#> NULL
```

## mkonfound for meta-analyses including sensitivity analysis

`mkonfound()` supports sensitivity that can be compared or synthesized
across multiple analyses. We can use an existing (and built-in) dataset,
such as `mkonfound_ex`.
