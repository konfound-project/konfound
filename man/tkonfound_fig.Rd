\title{Draw figures for change in effect size as a function of switching or replacing outcomes}
\usage{
tkonfound_fig(
  a,
  b,
  c,
  d,
  thr_p = 0.05,
  switch_trm = T,
  test = "fisher",
  replace = "control"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{cell is the number of cases in the control group showing unsuccessful results}

\item{b}{cell is the number of cases in the control group showing successful results}

\item{c}{cell is the number of cases in the treatment group showing unsuccessful results}

\item{d}{cell is the number of cases in the treatment group showing successful results}

\item{thr_p}{the p-value threshold used to evaluate statistical significance, with the default of 0.05}

\item{switch_trm}{whether switching the two cells in the treatment row or the two cells in the control row, with the default of the treatment row}

\item{test}{whether using Fisher's Exact Test (default) or chi-square test}

\item{replace}{whether using entire sample or the control group to calculate the base rate, with the default of the entire sample}
}
\value{
prints 2 figures for how number of hypothetical cases switched changes the effect size
}
\description{
This function returns two plots for change in effect size as a function of switching or replacing outcomes, one for all possibilities (switching), another zoomed in the area for positive RIR
}
\examples{
# using tkonfound_fig for a study where 2 by 2 table is (35, 17, 17, 38)
tkonfound_fig(35, 17, 17, 38)
tkonfound_fig(35, 17, 17, 38, thr_p = 0.01)

tkonfound_fig(35, 17, 17, 38, thr_p = 0.01, switch_trm = TRUE, test = "chisq")
tkonfound_fig(35, 17, 17, 38, thr_p = 0.01, switch_trm = TRUE, test = "chisq", replace = "control")
