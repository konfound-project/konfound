\arguments{
\item{est_eff}{the estimated effect (such as an unstandardized beta coefficient or a group mean difference)}

\item{n_covariates}{the number of covariates in the regression model}

\item{alpha}{probability of rejecting the null hypothesis (defaults to 0.05)}

\item{tails}{integer whether hypothesis testing is one-tailed (1) or two-tailed (2; defaults to 2)}

\item{index}{whether output is RIR or IT (impact threshold); defaults to "RIR"}

\item{nu}{what hypothesis to be tested; defaults to testing whether est_eff is significantly different from 0}

\item{n_treat}{the number of cases associated with the treatment condition; applicable only when model_type = "logistic"}

\item{switch_trm}{whether to switch the treatment and control cases; defaults to FALSE; applicable only when model_type = "logistic"}

\item{model_type}{the type of model being estimated; defaults to "ols" for a linear regression model; the other option is "logistic"}

\item{a}{cell is the number of cases in the control group showing unsuccessful results}

\item{b}{cell is the number of cases in the control group showing successful results}

\item{c}{cell is the number of cases in the treatment group showing unsuccessful results}

\item{d}{cell is the number of cases in the treatment group showing successful results}

\item{two_by_two_table}{table that is a matrix or can be coerced to one (data.frame, tibble, tribble) from which the a, b, c, and d arguments can be extracted}

\item{test}{whether using Fisher's Exact Test or A chi-square test; defaults to Fisher's Exact Test}

\item{replace}{whether using entire sample or the control group to calculate the base rate; default is control}

\item{sdx}{the standard deviation of X}

\item{sdy}{the standard deviation of Y}

\item{R2}{the unadjusted,original R2 in the observed function}

\item{far_bound}{whether the estimated effect is moved to the boundary closer (default 0) or further away (1);}

\item{eff_thr}{for RIR: unstandardized coefficient threshold to change an inference; for IT: correlation defining the threshold for inference}

\item{FR2max}{the largest R2, or R2max, in the final model with unobserved confounder}

\item{FR2max_multiplier}{the multiplier of R2 to get R2max, default is set to 1.3}

\item{to_return}{whether to return a data.frame (by specifying this argument to equal "raw_output" for use in other analyses) or a plot ("plot"); default is to print ("print") the output to the console; can specify a vector of output to return}

\description{
For published studies, this command calculates (1) how much bias there must be in an estimate to invalidate/sustain an inference; (2) the impact of an omitted variable necessary to invalidate/sustain an inference for a regression coefficient.
