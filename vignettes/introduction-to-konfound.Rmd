# Introduction

In social science (and educational) research, we often wish to understand how robust inferences about effects are to unobserved (or controlled for) covariates, possible problems with measurement, and other sources of bias.  The goal of `konfound` is to carry out sensitivity analysis to help analysts to *quantify how robust inferences are to potential sources of bias*. This package provides functions based on developments in sensitivity analysis by Frank and colleagues, which previously have been implemented in `Stata` and through an Excel spreadsheet, in `R` through the `konfound` package. In particular, we provide functions for both *values from analyses carried out outside of R as well as from models (`lm()`, `glm()`, and `lme4::lmer()` fit in R)* for:

* Quantifying the bias necessary to alter an inference from the framework of Rubin's (1974) causal model
* The robustness of causal inference in terms of the impact threshold of a confounding variable

You can install `konfound` with the following:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("konfound")
```

You can then load konfound with the `library()` function:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(konfound)
```

## Use of pkonfound() for values from an already-conducted analysis

`pkonfound()` is used when we have values from an already-conducted analysis (like a regression analysis), such as one in an already-published study or from an analysis carried out using other software. 

In the case of a regression analysis, values from the analysis would simply be used as the inputs to the `pkonfound()` function. For example, in the use below, we simply enter the values for the estimated effect (an unstandardardized beta coefficient) (`2`), its standard error (`.4`), the sample size (`100`), and the number of covariates (`3`):

```{r}
pkonfound(2, .4, 100, 3)
```

For this set of values, around 60% would need to be false due to a source of bias for the inference to be invalidated (based on statistical significance and a p-value (or alpha) of .05), possible a very robust effect. An omitted, confounding variable (sometimes referred to as a covariate) would need to have an impact (defined as the product of the confounding variable's correlation with both the predictor of interest and the outcome) of 0.323, presenting a different interpretation of how robust this (hypothetical) effect is to a variable which is important but not included in the analysis. 

Here is another example, but one in which the unstandardized beta coefficient is smaller than its standard error:

```{r}
pkonfound(.4, 2, 100, 3)
```

Note that this use of `pkonfound()` is equivalent to naming the arguments, i.e. for a different set of values:

```{r}
pkonfound(est_eff = -2.2,
          std_err = .65, 
          n_obs = 200,
          n_covariates = 3)
```

We notice that the output includes a message that says we can view other forms of output by changing the `to_return` argument. Here are the two plots - for the bias necessary to alter an inference (`thresh_plot`) and for the robustness of an inference in terms of the impact of a confounding variable (`corr_plot`) that can be returned:

```{r}
pkonfound(.4, 2, 100, 3, to_return = "thresh_plot")
```

```{r}
pkonfound(.4, 2, 100, 3, to_return = "corr_plot")
```

Finally, you can return the raw output, for use in other analyses. 

```{r}
pkonfound(.4, 2, 100, 3, to_return = "raw_output")
```

This function can be used with the values from a two-by-two table associated with an intervention (represented as a dichotomous predictor variable) that is related with a binary outcome, such as one that could be modeled using a logistic regression. Below:

- `a` represents an unsuccessful control group outcome
- `b` represents a successful control group outcome
- `c` represents an unsuccessful treatment group outcome
- `d` represents a successful treatment group outcome

```{r}
# pkonfound(a = 35, b = 17, c = 17, d = 38)
```

A table can also be passed to this function: 

```{r}
# my_table <- tibble::tribble(
# ~unsuccess, ~success,
# 35,         17,
# 17,         38,
# )
# 
# pkonfound(two_by_two_table = my_table)
```

## Use of konfound() for models fit in R

Where `pkonfound()` can be used with values from already-conducted analyses, `konfound()` can be used with models (`lm()`, `glm()`, and `lme4::lmer()`) fit in R.

**For linear models fit with lm()**

```{r}
m1 <- lm(mpg ~ wt + hp + qsec, data = mtcars)
m1

konfound(m1, hp)
```

Whereas this cannot be carried out with `pkonfound()`, with `konfound()` you can also return a table with some key output from the correlation-based approach.

```{r}
konfound(m1, wt, to_return = "table")
```

If the impact threshhold is greater than the impacts of the `Z`s (the other covariates) then an omitted variable would have to have a greater impact than any of the observed covariates to change the inference. Note that in fields in which there is a lot known about covariates given the outcome of interest, then the omitted ones are likely less important than those that are known an included (i.e., we have a good sense of the factors that matter in terms of educational achievement).

**For logistic regression models fit with glm()**

Effects for these models are interpreted on the basis of average partial (or marginal) effects (calculated using the `margins` package).

```{r, message = F}
# if forcats is not installed, this install it first using install.packages("forcats") for this to run
if (requireNamespace("forcats")) {
    d <- forcats::gss_cat
    
    d$married <- ifelse(d$marital == "Married", 1, 0)
    
    m2 <- glm(married ~ age, data = d, family = binomial(link = "logit"))
    konfound(m2, age)
}
```

**For logistic regression models fit with glm() with a dichotomous predictor of interest**

```{r, eval = FALSE}
m4 <- glm(outcome ~ condition, data = binary_dummy_data)
konfound(m4, condition, two_by_two = TRUE)
```

**For mixed effects (or multi-level) models fit with the lmer() function from the lme4 package**

`konfound` also works with models fit with the `lmer()` function from the package `lme4`, for mixed-effects or multi-level models. One challenge with carrying out sensitivity analysis for fixed effects in mixed effects models is calculating the correct denominator degrees of freedom for the t-test associated with the coefficients. This is not unique to sensitivity analysis, as, for example, `lmer()` does not report degrees of freedom (or p-values) for fixed effects predictors (see this information in the `lme4` FAQ [here](http://bbolker.github.io/mixedmodels-misc/glmmFAQ.html#why-doesnt-lme4-display-denominator-degrees-of-freedomp-values-what-other-options-do-i-have)). While it may be possible to determine the correct degrees of freedom for some models (i.e., models with relatively simple random effects structures), it is difficult to generalize this approach, and so in this package the Kenward-Roger approximation for the denominator degrees of freedom as implemented in the `pbkrtest` package (described in [Halekoh and Højsgaard, 2014](https://www.jstatsoft.org/htaccess.php?volume=59&type=i&issue=09&paper=true)).

Here is an example of the use of `konfound()` with a model fit with `lmer()`:

```{r}
if (requireNamespace("lme4")) {
    library(lme4)
    m3 <- fm1 <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (1 | Subject), sleepstudy)
    konfound(m3, Days)
}
```

## Use of mkonfound() for meta-analyses that include sensitivity analysis

We can also use `konfound` to carry out sensitivity analysis as part of meta-analyses. For example, here, `d` represents output from a number (30 in this case) of past studies, read in a CSV file from a website:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
mkonfound_ex
mkonfound(mkonfound_ex, t, df)
```

We can also return a plot summarizing the percent bias needed to sustan or invalidate an inference across all of the past studies:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
mkonfound(mkonfound_ex, t, df, return_plot = TRUE)
```
